### Personal Goals
The reason I am working on this project is that I would like to learn more about the OpenGL API, and game-engine design in general.
When I started this project I tried to keep the scope small... Just a very basic Entity Component System, and some rendering. Perhaps I will add some physics as well, but I might save that for a future project.

**Key learning points:**
* OpenGL 2D sprite rendering
* Scene management
* Entity Component Systems
* Collision detection and resolution
* Dynamic key mapping
